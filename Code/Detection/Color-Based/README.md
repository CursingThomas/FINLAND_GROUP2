# Color Based Ripeness Detection

For now our Project will be using the Colors of the incoming Item to deceide
wether or not the object is ripe or not. 

## First Steps

### Requirements

For this Implementation to work u will need the following: 
- Numpy
- OpenCV 
- Python 3.x version
(The Version that worked best for me was 3.7)

## Installation of OpenCV (for Windows)

Installing OpenCV in ur Project IDE works with the following command: 
> pip install opencv-python

Importing the Module into the project is the following line:
> import cv2

But basically the installation should be done by running the requirements.txt
